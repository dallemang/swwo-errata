Perhaps the word **Identifier** was meant, like in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986.

On the same page, I think the word None should not be there:

Also, maybe in the list of serialization formats on the next line, N3, TriG and N-Quads might also be mentioned.

These observations are all correct. This is page 67 in the print edition.

I believe the diagram actually uses checkmark character :heavy_check_mark: to potray these items, not a boxed `x`.

I believe the words `SHACL shapes` should be in bold, just as the other terms in the **Fundamental concepts** list.
